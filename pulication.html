        <h4>PECJ: Stream Window Join on Disorder Data Streams with Proactive Error Compensation</h4>
        <details>
          <summary><h5>Abstract</h5></summary> 
      <p>
Stream Window Join (SWJ), a vital operation in stream analytics, struggles with achieving a balance between accuracy and latency due to out-of-order data arrivals. Existing methods predominantly rely on adaptive buffering, but often fall short in performance, thereby constraining practical applications. We introduce PECJ, a solution that proactively incorporates unobserved data to enhance accuracy while reducing latency, thus requiring robust predictive modeling of stream oscillation. At the heart of PECJ lies a mathematical formulation of the posterior distribution approximation (PDA) problem using variational inference (VI). This approach circumvents error propagation while meeting the low-latency demands of SWJ. We detail the implementation of PECJ, striking a balance between complexity and generality, and discuss both analytical and learning-based approaches. Experimental evaluations reveal PECJâ€™s superior performance. The successful integration of PECJ into a multi-threaded SWJ benchmark testbed further establishes its practical value, demonstrating promising advancements in enhancing data stream processing capabilities amidst out-of-order data.</p>

        <h4>Parallelizing Stream Compression for IoT Applications on Asymmetric Multicores</h4>
        <details>
          <summary><h5>Abstract</h5></summary> 
      <p>Data stream compression attracts much attention
        recently due to the rise of IoT applications. Thanks to
        the balanced computational power and energy consumption,
        asymmetric multicores are widely used in IoT devices. This
        paper introduces CStream, a novel framework for parallelizing
        stream compression on asymmetric multicores to minimize energy
        consumption without violating the user-specified compressing
        latency constraint. Existing works cannot effectively utilize
        asymmetric multicores for stream compression, primarily due
        to the non-trivial asymmetric computation and asymmetric
        communication effects. To this end, CStream is developed with the
        following two novel designs: 1) fine-grained decomposition, which
        decomposes a stream compression procedure into multiple finegrained
        tasks to better expose the task-core affinities under the
        asymmetric computation effects; and 2) asymmetry-aware task
        scheduling, which schedules the decomposed tasks based on a
        novel cost model to exploit the exposed task-core affinities while
        considering asymmetric communication effects. To validate our
        proposal, we evaluate CStream with five competing mechanisms
        of parallelizing stream compression algorithms on a recent
        asymmetric multicore processor. Our extensive experiments
        based on a benchmark consisting of three algorithms and four
        datasets, show that CStream outperforms alternative approaches
        by up to 53% lower energy consumption without compressing
        latency constraint violation.</p>

            <h4>A Hardware-Conscious Stateful Stream Compression
              Framework for IoT Applications (Visionary Paper)</h4>
            <details>
              <summary><h5>Abstract</h5></summary> 
          <p>Data stream compression has attracted vast interest in
            emerging IoT (Internet of Things) applications. However,
            adopting stream compression on IoT applications is
            non-trivial due to the divergent demands, i.e., low
            energy consumption, high throughput, low latency, high
            compressibility, and tolerable information loss, which
            sometimes conflict with each other. This is particularly
            challenging when adopting stateful stream compression
            algorithms, which rely on states, e.g., a dictionary or
            model. This paper presents our vision of CStream, a
            hardware-conscious stateful stream compression framework
            for IoT applications. Through careful hardware-conscious
            optimizations, CStream will minimize energy consumption
            while striving to satisfy the divergent performance demands
            for parallelizing complex stateful stream compression
            algorithms for IoT applications.</p>

                <h4>Scalable Online Interval Join on Modern Multicore
                  Processors in OpenMLDB</h4>
                <details>
                  <summary><h5>Abstract</h5></summary> 
              <p>OpenMLDB is an open-source machine learning
                database, that provides a feature platform computing consistent
                features for training and inference. The online interval join
                (OIJ ), i.e., joining two input streams over relative time intervals,
                is becoming a core operation in OpenMLDB. Its costly nature
                and intrinsic parallelism opportunities have created significant
                interest in accelerating OIJ on modern multicore processors.
                In this work, we first present an in-depth empirical study on
                an existing parallel OIJ algorithm (Key-OIJ ), which applies
                a key-partitioned parallelization strategy. Key-OIJ has been
                implemented in Apache Flink and used in real-world applications.
                However, our study points out the limitations of Key-OIJ ,
                and reveals that Key-OIJ is not capable of fully exploiting
                modern multicore processors. Based on our analysis, we propose
                a new approach, the Scale-OIJ algorithm with a set of
                optimization techniques. Compared with Key-OIJ , Scale-OIJ
                is particularly efficient for handling workloads involving fewer
                keys, large time intervals, and large lateness configurations. The
                extensive experiments using real workloads have demonstrated
                the superior performance of Scale-OIJ . Furthermore, we have
                partially integrated and tested Scale-OIJ in the latest version
                of OpenMLDB, demonstrating its practicality in a machine
                learning database.</p>
